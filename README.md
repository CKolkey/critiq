Final project during the coding bootcamp at Le Wagon Berlin. With a team of 3 we designed and developed this application to finally deploy it to production on heroku.

The goal of this was simple: human beings are biased and feedback can be a pain. Because people give false feedback to supervisors it's nearly impossible for them to receive honest opinions about their performance, and thus, to improve.

Critiq is a slack-integration that tackles this problem.

Surveys can easily be created on our webpage - the survey gets send out via a slackbot individually to each member of the channel that was selected. Each member can respond to each question directly in the private chat-window. The slackbot collects all responses anonymously and shows them on the dashboard of the web-application.
